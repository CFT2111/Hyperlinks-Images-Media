# Hyperlinks and Images
1.
    * Download [great-britain.txt](great-britain.txt). This file contains some information about the the countries that make up Great Britain.
    * Using this content, create a **separate** web page for each country.
        - Use the html template (https://github.com/CFT2111/Intro-to-HTML/blob/master/template.html) as your starting point and then copy in content from the *great-britain.txt* file.
        - Mark-up the content e.g. make the name of the country a *h1* element, add a title, create a list for the capital, population and area facts.
        - Validate each of the web pages using the w3c validator, http://validator.w3.org/ and fix any errors.

2.
    * Link the different pages together using the anchor element *a*.

3.
    * Insert an image of the countryâ€™s flag into each page.
        * Have a look the web to find images which are licensed for re-use (Wikipedia is often a good starting point).
        * If needed, make sure you also add appropriate attributions.

4.
    * Add some CSS to the website.
        * Create a single CSS file and link it to each of the HTML pages.
        * Change basic properties such as the fonts and colours for the pages.

5.
    * Experiment with hyperlink and image related CSS properties e.g
        * Pseudo-classes for hyperlinks
        * Styling images using CSS
